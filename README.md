# cryfetch

### A (not-so) simple CLI System Information tool written in the Crystal Programming Language.

Think of it as a version of [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) or [ufetch](https://github.com/jschx/ufetch), but written in Crystal, specifically for macOS. (Mojave and above)

## Installation

**Clone the repo** <br>
```git clone https://github.com/okavatti/cryfetch.git```

**Build the project** <br>
```cd cryfetch``` <br>
```crystal build src/cryfetch.cr -o cryfetch --release```

**Run the code** *(optional, mainly for testing)*<br>
```./cryfetch```

**Install**<br>
```sudo cp cryfetch /usr/local/bin```

## Uninstall

```sudo rm /usr/local/bin/cryfetch```

## Usage

```cryfetch [options]```

options are available by running ```cryfetch -h```

## Development

Don't. I beg of you. For your own sake. Please don't. This programming language is a nightmare to work with.
